# 8. CHALLENGE: Make Fruit Treats
fruits = ["apple", "blueberry", "cantaloupe", "cherry", "grape", "kiwi", "mango", "orange", "peach", "pear", "plum", "pineapple", "raspberry", "strawberry", "tangerine"]

# loop the fruits and make  "jam", "popsicles", "jelly" or "jellybeans"
# according to these conditions:

# - if the fruit is a 'berry', make jam ("strawberry jam")
# - if it starts with "p", make a popsicle ("plum popsicle")
# - if the fruit consists of 5 letters or less, make jelly ("apple jelly", "kiwi jelly")
# - if none of these conditions apply, make jellybean ("cherry jellybean")

# don't just print the fruit treats
# save the fruit treats to a new list, called treats,
# rather than just printing the treats; this way,
# the treats will be available throughout the code

# 9. before starting if-else logic part..
# sort() fruits and then add more fruits:
# append() 'watermelon' to end of fruits:
# insert() 'apricot' at correct spot to maintain A-Z order (without sorting again)
# insert() 'banana' at correct spot to maintain A-Z order (without sorting again)

# 'watermelon'
# 'apricot'
# 'banana'
print()
# List of fruits
fruits = ["apple", "blueberry", "cantaloupe", "cherry", "grape", "kiwi", "mango", "orange",
"peach", "pear", "plum", "pineapple", "raspberry", "strawberry", "tangerine"]

# Step 1: Sort the fruits list
fruits.sort()

# Step 2: Add more fruits while maintaining alphabetical order
fruits.insert(fruits.index("blueberry"), "banana") # Insert 'banana' before 'blueberry'
fruits.insert(fruits.index("cherry"), "apricot") # Insert 'apricot' before 'cherry'
fruits.append("watermelon") # Append 'watermelon' at the end

# Step 3: Create the treats list
treats = []

# Step 4: Process each fruit based on the given conditions
for fruit in fruits:
    if "berry" in fruit:
      treats.append(f"{fruit} jam") # Make jam for berries
    elif fruit.startswith("p"):
      treats.append(f"{fruit} popsicle") # Make popsicles for 'p' fruits
    elif len(fruit) <= 5:
      treats.append(f"{fruit} jelly") # Make jelly for fruits with 5 or fewer letters
    else:
      treats.append(f"{fruit} jellybean") # Make jellybeans for all others

# Step 5: Print the results
print("Final treats list:")
print(treats)
